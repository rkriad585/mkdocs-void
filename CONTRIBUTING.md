!!! tip "Full guide"
    The detailed contributing guide lives in the docs:
    **[Contributing to Void](docs/contributing.md)** — issue labels, PR
    checklist, testing expectations, code style, and recipes.

## Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style
- Use BEM naming with `void-` prefix for CSS classes
- Keep JavaScript vanilla (no frameworks)
- Test changes across dark and light modes
- Verify responsive behavior on mobile viewports
- Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements

## Commit Guidelines

Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`. The `feat:`/`fix:`/…`
prefix drives the [auto-generated changelog](CHANGELOG.md) (`tools/emit_changelog.py`),
so it is part of the feature, not a nicety.

## Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused on a single change
- Use Conventional Commits titles (`feat: …`, `fix: …`, `docs: …`)
- Include a clear description of what changed and why
- Update documentation if adding new features
- Ensure `tools/emit_config_reference.py` is run after plugin config changes
- Ensure `mkdocs build --clean` succeeds without warnings

## Reporting Issues

Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/rkriad585/mkdocs-void/issues) to report bugs or request features.

## Good First Issues

New to the project? Start with a

[`good first issue`](https://github.com/rkriad585/mkdocs-void/labels/good%20first%20issue)
— issues we tag as small, well-scoped, and friendly to a first contributor.
[`help wanted`](https://github.com/rkriad585/mkdocs-void/labels/help%20wanted)
issues need a maintainer assist and are fair game too. Say “I'll take this” in
the issue thread before opening a PR so nobody collides.

## Translations

Void chrome strings live in `_VOID_DEFAULT_I18N` (`void/plugins/void_plugin.py`)
and are overridable per site with `theme.void.i18n` — see
[Translating Void](docs/identity.md#translating-void) for the full
onboarding (which keys exist, how flat aliases map, how to verify a build).
