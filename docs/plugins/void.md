# Void Plugin

The `void` MkDocs plugin sets theme defaults so you don't have to configure everything manually.

## Installation

The plugin is bundled with `mkdocs-void`. No separate install needed.

## Enable

Add `void` to the `plugins` list in `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
site_name: My Docs
theme:
  name: void

plugins:
  - search
  - void
```

## What It Does

The plugin hooks into MkDocs' `on_config` event to set default values for theme options that are not explicitly configured:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `language` | `"en"` | Site language |
| `direction` | `"ltr"` | Text direction |
| `features` | `[]` | Always-on passthrough list (does not gate behavior) |
| `palette` | `[]` | Color schemes |
| `font.text` | `"Space Grotesk"` | Display/body font |
| `font.code` | `"Space Mono"` | Code font |
| `void.glass` | `"medium"` | Glass intensity |
| `void.dot_matrix` | `true` | Dot matrix pattern |
| `void.animation` | `"normal"` | Animation mode |
| `void.border` | `"thin"` | Border style |
| `void.social_cards` | `{"enabled": true, "jsonld": true, "cards": true}` | Social preview cards + JSON-LD |
| `void.meta` | `{"enabled": true, "show_last_updated": true, "show_edit_on_github": true, ...}` | Last-updated + edit-on-GitHub bar |

If you set these values in `mkdocs.yml`, the plugin will not override them.

## Configuration

The plugin reads its configuration from the `void` key under `theme`:

```yaml
theme:
  name: void
  void:
    glass: medium
    dot_matrix: true
    animation: normal
    border: thin
```

### `glass`

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `"light"` | Subtle blur, high transparency |
| `"medium"` | Balanced blur and opacity (default) |
| `"heavy"` | Strong blur, lower transparency |

### `dot_matrix`

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `true` | Render dot matrix pattern (default) |
| `false` | Disable dot matrix |

### `animation`

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `"normal"` | Enable animations (default) |
| `"none"` | Disable all animations |

### `border`

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `"thin"` | 1px semi-transparent borders (default) |
| `"thick"` | 2px borders |
| `"none"` | No borders |

### `social_cards`

Automatic per-page social preview cards and Article structured data. When enabled alongside `extra.void_og_image: __auto__`, the build generates a 1200×630 Open Graph image for every page (drawn in the theme palette with the site logo) and injects matching `og:image` meta plus JSON-LD Article data into each page's `<head>`.

```yaml
theme:
  name: void
  void:
    social_cards:
      enabled: true   # Master switch for social previews
      jsonld: true    # Inject Article JSON-LD structured data
      cards: true     # Generate + publish per-page og:image cards

extra:
  void_og_image: __auto__  # Auto-generate one card per page
```

> To embed the site's own logo on the cards, set `theme.logo` to a local file (e.g. `assets/images/logo.svg`); it is used when the `void_logo_light`/`void_logo_dark` extras point at remote URLs, which are skipped at build time.
>
> Cards are rendered as PNG when [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org) is installed, otherwise as standalone SVG. Install the extra with `pip install mkdocs-void[social-cards]`. An author can override the auto image for a single page with a `image:` entry in that page's front matter.

### `meta`

Freshness bar: a "Last updated" date and an "Edit this page" link under
the content. The date reads `page.meta.git_revision_date_localized` when the
`mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized` plugin is installed (package on PyPI:
`mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin`), falls back to the
page's `date:` front matter, and is omitted when neither is present (so nothing
breaks without the git plugin). The edit link points at the page source in the
repository configured by `repo_url`.

```yaml
theme:
  name: void
  void:
    meta:
      enabled: true                # master on/off
      show_last_updated: true      # "Last updated: <date>"
      show_edit_on_github: true    # "Edit this page"
      date_source: auto            # auto | git | front_matter
      branch: main
      source_dir: docs
```

### `feedback`

"Was this page helpful?" widget. Renders under the article and opens a
prefilled GitHub issue in a new tab (`repo_url` + `github_labels` are read from
the site config) — a plain issue link, no analytics, no tracking. Only appears
when `config.repo_url` is set.

```yaml
theme:
  name: void
  void:
    feedback:
      enabled: true                # master on/off
      title: Was this page helpful?
      positive: Yes — thanks!
      negative: No — open an issue
      github_labels: [feedback]
```

### `announcement_bar`

Announcement bar: one line in a floating glass card — **off by default**,
it renders only when `enabled: true` and a non-empty `text` are set. Text comes
from `announcement_bar.text`, falling back to the legacy `extra.void_announce`
string. Dismissal is remembered in `localStorage` (keyed by the text), so
changing the announcement re-shows it. `position` floats the card
(`top`/`right`/`bottom`/`left`) or opens it as a centered popup with a backdrop
(`center`; clicking the backdrop dismisses).

```yaml
theme:
  name: void
  void:
    announcement_bar:
      enabled: true    # opt-in — hidden by default
      text: New release! Check the changelog.
      dismissable: true
      position: bottom # top | right | bottom | left | center (popup)
```

### `cookie_consent`

Consent banner. Privacy-first: Void ships no trackers, so the banner
renders by default only when a real integration is configured (`theme.analytics.gtag`
or giscus comments with `repo` + `repo_id`). Set `render: always` to force-show
it on a demo site (and `render: never` to hide it even with integrations). It
stores nothing but an accept/decline flag; clicking **Accept** unlocks delayed
integrations (giscus) that are otherwise never loaded. `position` floats the card
(`top`/`right`/`bottom`/`left`) or opens it as a centered popup with a backdrop
(`center`; the backdrop is inert — only Accept/Decline settle the prompt).

```yaml
theme:
  name: void
  void:
    cookie_consent:
      message: This site stores nothing about you unless you enable integrations.
      accept_label: Accept
      decline_label: Decline
      privacy_policy: ""
      render: always         # auto (default) | always | never
      position: bottom       # top | right | bottom | left | center (popup)
```

### `comments`

Opt-in comments via [giscus](https://giscus.app) — the only supported
provider. Comments are **hidden by default**; set `enabled: true` to show them.
Both `repo` and `repo_id` are required before anything loads; when a
consent-serving integration is present, the scripts are deferred until the
reader accepts. The giscus theme follows the active palette with per-scheme
themes in `light` / `dark` (`comments.theme`). Grab the exact IDs on the [giscus setup
page](https://giscus.app) for your repository. `theme.analytics.gtag` is honored by the theme as a Google Analytics passthrough.

Use an **Announcements**-type category so only maintainers and the giscus bot
can start discussions. With `mapping: pathname` each page maps to a discussion
whose title equals the page pathname without the leading slash (e.g. the home
page `/mkdocs-void/` → a discussion titled `mkdocs-void/`).

```yaml
theme:
  name: void
  void:
    comments:
      enabled: true          # opt-in — comments are hidden by default
      provider: giscus
      repo: "user/mkdocs-docs"
      repo_id: "R_kgxxxx"
      category: "Announcements"    # Announcements-type so only you/giscus post
      category_id: "DIC_xxxx"
      mapping: pathname            # pathname | url | title | og:title | specific
      term: ""                     # used with mapping: specific
      theme:
        light: light
        dark: dark
```

## Full Example

```yaml
site_name: My Docs
theme:
  name: void
  palette:
    - scheme: slate
      primary: black
      accent: red
      toggle:
        name: Switch to light mode
    - scheme: default
      primary: white
      accent: red
      toggle:
        name: Switch to dark mode
  font:
    text: Space Grotesk
    code: Space Mono
  void:
    glass: medium
    dot_matrix: true
    animation: normal
    border: thin
    content:
      typography:
        image_lightbox: true  # click-to-zoom image preview in the article (default true; set false to disable)

plugins:
  - search
  - void
```

## Optional

The plugin is optional. If you remove it from the plugins list, you must set all theme options manually in `mkdocs.yml`. The theme will still work, but without automatic defaults.

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not found

Ensure the package is installed:

```bash
pip show mkdocs-void
```

If not installed:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-void
```

### Defaults not applied

Check that `void` is in the `plugins` list and that there are no YAML syntax errors in `mkdocs.yml`.

!!! warning
    The plugin reads its configuration at build time. It does not support runtime configuration or per-page overrides.
